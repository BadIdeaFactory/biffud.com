Yet his battered people retain a way of being, a joie de vivre, that belies the things they've seen. Perhaps their spirit took form not despite, but because of their hardships.</p>\n<p>Today, Matt boasts numerous cafes and fast-casual eateries which, though derivative of more happening locales, make for a pleasant weekend. If you've been to even a single Old Town before, you can safely pass on Matt's historical sights and museums. Along Matt's river, you will find precious little green space. Do not miss the characters, avian and otherwise, at the bird market.</p>\n<p>If you're visiting Matt, allow several days to adjust to the language, which can feel jarring and far too rapid at first. Many visitors arrive because of the transport links, and depart soon after. That's a shame, because there's more to experience than your first impressions will suggest.

Do not miss the characters, avian and otherwise, at the bird market.</p>\n<p>If you're visiting Matt, allow several days to adjust to the language, which can feel jarring and far too rapid at first. Many visitors arrive because of the transport links, and depart soon after. That's a shame, because there's more to experience than your first impressions will suggest.

Do not miss the characters, avian and otherwise, at the bird market.</p>\n<p>If you're visiting Matt, allow several days to adjust to the language, which can feel jarring and far too rapid at first. Many visitors arrive because of the transport links, and depart soon after. That's a shame, because there's more to experience than your first impressions will suggest.

Do not miss the characters, avian and otherwise, at the bird market.</p>\n<p>If you're visiting Matt, allow several days to adjust to the language, which can feel jarring and far too rapid at first. Many visitors arrive because of the transport links, and depart soon after. That's a shame, because there's more to experience than your first impressions will suggest. With sufficient advanced preparation, your Matt experience will be a positive one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"information\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#information\" aria-label=\"information permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>INFORMATION</h2>\n<h3 id=\"internet-access\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#internet-access\" aria-label=\"internet access permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Internet Access</h3>\n<p>Although boasting an unprecedented degree of connectivity, response times can be an issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"internet-resources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#internet-resources\" aria-label=\"internet resources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Internet Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://mattstempeck.com\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mattstempeck.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://civictech.guide\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://civictech.guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mstem\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/mstem</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"money\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#money\" aria-label=\"money permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Money</h3>\n<p>Matt accepts many currencies.
