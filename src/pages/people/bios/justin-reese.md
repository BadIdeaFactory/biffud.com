When not being a debut album, Justin [produces films](https://www.makedowith.com/), [shoots grainy photos of his children](https://www.instagram.com/reefdog/), and impersonates celebrities (pictured).

With BIFFUD, he’s contributed bugs to [Talking Point Tracker](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/talking-point-tracker) and [Tech & Check Alerts](https://github.com/TechAndCheck/tech-and-check-alerts). Without BIFFUD, he’d probably be a productive member of society.
