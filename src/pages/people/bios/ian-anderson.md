Ian Anderson is frustratingly difficult to google. Instead of a progressive rock flautist, Ian is a researcher / engineer / scientist trying to make bad ideas a reality.

Previously, he worked on his PhD from Johns Hopkins in particle physics, dealing mostly with the Higgs boson - mostly its discovery and properties. After finding that the universe is drearily like the Standard Model, he made the obvious transition to music and has been working at Spotify since 2015. There he's been working mostly on user behavior, recommendations, machine learing, and other buzzwords. In 2017, he designed and built the model behind Your Time Capsule which is a pretty rad system that gives personalized nostalgic tracks.

As of writing, Ian is the only corporate overlord to deliver a creative work to BIFFUD for approval. It was a freeform jazz piano version of "Ain't Misbehavin' " originally by Andy Razaf, Fats Waller, and Harry Brooks. Ian does not know how to play an instrument. It was terrible and therefore well received.
