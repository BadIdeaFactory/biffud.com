Julia is a software developer/product designer/data journalist/occasional manager working in or around newsrooms since 2008. She has a special place in her heart for local and nonprofit news, and her work has appeared in Mother Jones, National Geographic, Reveal by the Center for Investigative Reporting, The Chicago Reporter, and maybe a handful of other places. She was once a Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow, which was neat.

Julia has a journalism degree, and she’s currently earning her M.S. in Information Design & Strategy from Northwestern University. She's very midwestern and has an anxious dog that she likes a lot.
