Dan studied at the MIT Media Lab's Center for Civic Media, funded by Knight Foundation.  After graduating he became an Open News Fellow at the Boston Globe, funded by Knight foundation.  Dan helped Mark Boas found an open source transcript-based video editor called Hyperaudio, funded by Knight foundation.  This attracted the attention of Roger Macdonald, who asked Dan to join the Internet Archive and help build out the Political Ad Archive, funded by Knight Foundation.  He would go on to apply this technology to Bad Idea Factory's first official project: the Glorious Contextubot, funded by Knight Foundation.

Oh also Dan won a News Challenge grant in 2007.
