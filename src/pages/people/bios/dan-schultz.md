Dan studied at the MIT Media Lab's Center for Civic Media, funded by [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).  After graduating he became an Open News Fellow at the Boston Globe, funded by [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).  Dan helped Mark Boas found an open source transcript-based video editor called Hyperaudio, funded by [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).

All of this attracted the attention of Roger Macdonald, who asked Dan to join the Internet Archive and help build out the Political Ad Archive, funded by [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).  He would go on to apply this technology to Bad Idea Factory's first official project: the Glorious Contextubot, funded by [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).
