Laura Olin used to be a political hack and now runs a tiny company to help causes, companies, and campaigns with their digital strategy. She was Obama's social media director in 2012, helped launch the Hillary digital operation in 2016, and has worked with the Gates Foundation, EMILY's List, and most of the cooler Democratic political committees (yes, there is a loose ranking).

In her spare time she plays with her extremely great dog, makes email newsletters, and is the lone thirtysomething still on Tumblr. She lives in New York City.
