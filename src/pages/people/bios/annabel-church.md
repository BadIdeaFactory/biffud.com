Annabel is a people person with a computer habit, a developer who specialises in civic tech and tech journalism. She consults, designs, and builds tech with care.

The Guardian news organisation was her slippery slope into tech journalism and her OpenNews fellowship brought her to the strange world of change-making. She is a long-time and long-suffering organiser of Hacks/Hackers Berlin and believes that people are the solution to the technology problem.
