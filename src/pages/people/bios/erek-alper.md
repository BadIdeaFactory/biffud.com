```
Come gather round children and I'll tell you
the tale of Erek Alper, brave and true.
He yearned to know the workings of the world,
and studied physics - its secrets unfurled.
Inside a lab he toiled day and night,
but yearned for more! Alas, that was his plight.
To school he returned for many a year,
observing double stars both far and near.
His knowledge quenched, he realized his mistake!
Professorships are a severe headache.
Degrees in hand and growing older still,
Our hero sought a job to fit his skill.
So now he codes; bytes dance at his command,
while BIFFUD spreads its love across the land.
