Anthony is a technology consultant, developer and internet denizen. He
likes to solve problems, bridge IT and business, and in his spare time
helps runs a non profit that provides volunteer consulting services for
non profits (inception!). In his day job, he focuses on wrangling data
and using mostly older technologies to help clients work more
efficiently.

Among his r/mildlyinteresting accomplishments are degrees
in Information Systems from CMU and UVA, a mess of certificates saying
he's a Project Management Professional, Agile ScrumMaster, knows some
stuff about various Microsoft technologies, and a Wikipedia article for
something he built but isn't cited by name. He likes trying new
restaurants around Washington DC, traveling to new places and being the
first to try ultimately abandoned technology (worked at Blockbuster,
used Compuserve, Palm Pilot, MySpace, Second Life, Jaiku, Digg, Fancy,
Jaiku, Google Wave...but never Google+)
