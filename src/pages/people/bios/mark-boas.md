Part-time vegetarian and aspiring self-deprecating web-developer, enjoys burning food and ruining perfectly servicible gardens, WLTM partners with a GSOH.

In his spare time Mark has been an OpenNews guinea pig (2012), unlikely co-founder of Trint, Hyperaudio and the improbably-once-popular open source media library jPlayer.

Mark was also involved with making (and managed not to derail) Palestine Remix, The Studs Terkel Radio Archive and The Glorious Contextubot.

5'7" (M, 48). Possibly out of his depth with today's youth. Reply to box no.8426. KTHX!
