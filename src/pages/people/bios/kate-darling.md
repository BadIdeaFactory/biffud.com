Kate Darling (\"The Popular One\") is probably supposed to be in charge of social media accounts and comms at Bad Idea Factory, but she prefers to take the name of her elected position literally.

Also known as Dr. Kate Darling, Mistress of Machines, she has a side-gig as a robot ethics expert and researcher at MIT’s Media Lab, where she investigates social robotics and conducts experimental studies on human-robot interaction. Her acclaimed writing and research anticipate the bad ideas that lawmakers, engineers, and the wider public will come up with as human-robot relationships evolve in the coming decades.

Forever interested in how technology intersects with society, Kate also has a background in law & economics and intellectual property. In 2017, the American Bar Association honored her legal work with the Mark T. Banner award and refused to publish the video of her acceptance speech, which involved her doing a shot of tequila.

Kate is the caretaker for several domestic robots, including her Pleos Yochai, Peter, and Mr. Spaghetti. When she isn’t tweeting for @biffud, she tweets as @grok\_ about eating Cheerios for dinner.
