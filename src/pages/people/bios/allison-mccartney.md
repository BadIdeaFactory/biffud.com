Allison is a journalist, developer, designer, occasional printmaker, Opinion Haver about San Francisco taquerias, lover of Gritty, and Buyer of Too Many Things on the Internet.

In her day job she turns data into visualizations and pictures for the betterment of public knowledge. Recently, sheâ€™s done live election results for the midterm elections, and a tracker for how women candidates did in the 2018 primary season.

In her spare time, Allison wishes she did more interesting things in her spare time.
