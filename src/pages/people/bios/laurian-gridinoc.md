Laurian Gridinoc is our token unemployable generalist: he holds an MBBS/BSc in Medicine and an MSc in Computational Linguistics, and he is a digital nomad — basically nobody knows what he knows or where he is, that’s why his friends build [AskGridinoc.com](https://askgridinoc.com/) as they needed his opinion when he was unreachable, which is most of the time.**¹**

Laurian was an [OpenNews](https://opennews.org/) Fellow with BBC News Specials, helped Mark Boas with the [Hyperaudio](https://hyperaud.io/) API, then with its custom implementations for Al Jazeera’s [Palestine Remix](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/PalestineRemix/) and recently the [Studs Terkel Radio Archive](https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/) one. This habit of working with Mark got him involved with [Trint](https://trint.com/), but that’s a different and darker story. More positive recent projects include [InterviewJS](https://interviewjs.io/) for Al Jazeera, [The Glorious Contextubot](https://biffud.com/projects/contextubot) and [BBC News Labs’ Accessible Narrative Text](https://biffud.com/projects/accessible-narrative-text).
