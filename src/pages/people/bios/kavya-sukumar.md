Kavya is a developer with a journalism habit. She likes all things at the intersection of technology and media and has adopted developer-journalist as her professional identity. Pre-hyphenation she was a developer with a personal blog, which someone later described as "graffiti with punctuation." The modest success of her blog led her to believe that journalism is a viable career option for her. On that belief, she got a masters degree in journalism from Northwestern University, thanks to a generous scholarship from the Knight Foundation. She was an OpenNews fellow in 2015, again thanks to the Knight Foundation. 

She has been working in newsrooms since 2013 analyzing data, building tools, creating dataviz and custom story layouts and occasionally fixing newsroom printers.
