    text: Technology is entering an era when we are beginning to incarnate software development companies that are governed with the idealism and creativity that inhabits any designer and engineer who has understood how many worlds can be opened through just one point of variation - the 01 binary….these small collectives of open source devotees and social creatives are going to usher in the next public incarnation of this idealism, and this time its going to put the people in front of the platforms and our data firmly in our control. These new collectives are the hope for the future of our knowledge ecosystem, and probably our species.
