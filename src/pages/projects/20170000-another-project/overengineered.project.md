Diplomacy is a game that breaks people. It involves betrayal and backstabbing over a long period of time. The premise is simple: the players are all world powers and they control armies. Each power wants to control as much territory as possible. All moves are deterministic, there is no randomness to the game. However, people can lie about what they plan to do.

Playing diplomacy is a bad idea in itself, but writing complex code to publicly render an otherwise private, simple game is a genuine waste of raw creative energy.
