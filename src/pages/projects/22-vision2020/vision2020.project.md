Seat at the Table is a modern installation that commemorates the 19th Amendment — establishing women’s right to vote — and asks 100 years later, “Where are we now?”

You and I both know we’re not as far along as we’d like. But the achievements women have made in the past century are undeniable, not just in politics, but in the fields of business, STEM, sports, media and more. We collaborated with [Dome Collective](https://domecollective.com/), a women-owned experience design studio, to create the digital interactive portion of this exhibition.

Here’s to the next 100 years to achieve true equality for women in leadership roles in society.
