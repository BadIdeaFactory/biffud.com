Tech & Check Alerts sifts through hours of political blather in order to find phrases that a fact checker is more likely to care about.  Under the hood it is a queue system that knows how to scrape various sources, process the results, identify likely claims, and email out tip lists to people who are interested in researching them and finding the facts.
