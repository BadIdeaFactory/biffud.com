Truth Goggles is trying to help people ðŸ¤” more carefully when reading information online. It's based on cutting edge science about all the ways people can dupe themselves when facing information that challenges their world view. There are so many ways. This project is funded by the Duke Reporter's Lab (and ultimately by The Knight Foundation, and Facebook).

The short summary is this: we are trying to build interfaces that promote the establishment of respect and rapport with readers online.  There is already has part of a chapter dedicated to why it's a terrible idea in [To Save Everything Click Here](https://www.amazon.com/Save-Everything-Click-Here-Technological/dp/1610393708).

It is being built in the form of a series of experiments; you can [learn more about them here](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/truthgoggles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22experiment+idea%22).
