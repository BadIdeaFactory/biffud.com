Little known fact: all video on the Internet was originally aired on television. The Glorious Contextubot is an effort to recontextualize viral video by figuring out all the times it was broadcast.

We have a very simple four step plan.

* **Step 1:** Record all television aired anywhere at any time.
* **Step 2:** Use reverse video search to find when a video showed up on TV.
* **Step 3:** Compile a summary of what happened before and after.
* **Step 4:** TURN EVERYTHING INTO A COMIC BOOK.
