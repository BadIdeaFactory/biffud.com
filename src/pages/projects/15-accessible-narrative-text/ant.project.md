You may be asking yourself "What is Narrative Text?" - it's a fair question and one of those things that when it's explained to you, you instantly realise that you actually knew what it was, but just didn't know what it was called, because it had never cropped up in day-to-day conversation.

So here goes - Narrative Text is text that is displayed over the top of video to describe elements of the story. Click the images on the right to see what we mean -->

Working closely with the BBC, BIF took on the challenge of making BBC News' Narrative Text content accessible. BBC News had recently revamped the style and animation of their Narrative Text and wanted to make sure that as well as looking good, it was accessible to as many people as possible. BIF stepped up to the challenge of using web technologies such as CSS and HTML to reproduce currently 'burned-in' Narrative Text, thereby allowing this text to be accessible by screenreaders and so accessible by the visually impaired. Hurrah!
