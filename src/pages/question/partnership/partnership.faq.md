# Is this real?
This is probably the most real thing on the Internet.

# How do I join?

First things first, if you have died or uploaded your brain to the cloud you can't be a part of Bad Idea Factory.

Assuming otherwise, there are three ways to become an associate:

1. **Accomplices** are people who contribute to a BIFFUD project.  Maybe that means code, design, writing, or really any other way that a project owner deems significant. You might be compensated with money, but you *definitely* walk away with glory.

2. **Members** own BIFFUD projects. If you [submit an idea](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/issues/new?template=project-application.md) that gets approved by the organization, you become a member.

3. **Corporate Overlords** are the owners of BIFFUD itself.  They meet once a month to vote on project approvals and other Very Important Things during Plotting Sessions.

Applying to become a Corporate Overlord involves [filling out an application](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/issues/new?template=corporate-overlord-application.md), presenting an original creative work for our amusement, getting approved, and making a $300 capital contribution.

# How does money work at BIFFUD?

There are two kinds of project here: *fun* and *funded*.

We try to give all fun projects a small stipend to support basics like domain names, server costs, and maybe an thank you gift for any Accomplices who help out.

[Our bylaws](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/blob/master/documents/operating.md#section-4--money-) outline the way we handle situations where a project get funded or otherwise bring in money (e.g. through donations orâ€¦ sales? How does business work?)

### BIFFUD... 
* Keeps 2.4% of gross income for any project, which is basically nothing,
* provides communal resources (e.g. developer licenses, premium emoji, accounting, an amazing brand),
* is probably going to go bankrupt.

### Project Owners...
* Have control over how they use their project's money,
* can pay themselves and others,
* can acquire corporate assets / licenses, whatever,
* are responsible for delivering on commitments.

If a project has profit, BIFFUD Corporate keeps 20% of that.

*Note: we recommend that anybody working on projects with no budget get some ownership for their time.*

# Will you build my bad idea for me?
No. Wait, will you pay us? If so then maybe!

What we do is provide a community of support to help YOU expertly implement your bad idea. Don't despair though: folks around here are in it for the fun; you might be able to convince someone to lend a hand for the wrong cause.

# I don't code or design, can I still participate?

Yes! Writing, sharing, being a fan, donating, and engaging with our community are all spectacular ways to keep the collective momentum alive. Pick a [pateron tier](https://www.patreon.com/biffud), watch our [livestreamed coding sessions](https://www.twitch.tv/biffud), engage with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/biffud), pitch bad ideas and [help find accomplices](https://linkedin.com) to push them into reality with you.

# What is the time commitment?

That's up to you.  We ask Corporate Overlords to commit around 5 hours a month and attend a monthly Plotting Session.  Project owners should expect to commit 10 hours a month to keep their vision moving.
