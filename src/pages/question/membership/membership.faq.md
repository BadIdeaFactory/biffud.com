# I still don't get it.

That is understandable.

# So people have actually given you money to make things?

Yes. We were equally shocked to learn that there are organizations willing to write a check to something called Bad Idea Factory.

Every accounting department we have worked with gets genuinely concerned.

# And you actually followed through?

Is that so hard to beli-- ah, right. Yes, we did!

# Is it really legal to have a [cis-hetero white male identity continuation clause](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/blob/master/documents/operating.md#company-term)?

It is our opinion that it is perfectly legal to automatically close a company if all owners identify as cis-hetro white men, but this theory has not yet been tested in court. (We've also got a [Mario Party arbitrartion clause](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/blob/master/documents/operating.md#lawsuits-between-biffud-associates), so, you know.)

In general, regarding [BIFFUD's bylaws](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/blob/master/documents/operating.md), our lawyer said, and we quote:

> The document you created was insane. As long as you and the other cofounders understand what you are trying to do, it will work.

Our lawyer stressed that it was important for all terms to be well defined and understood, so we [made a flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/master/documents/flowcharts/biffud-hetero-cis-white-male-decision-tree.jpg) to help people understand if they identify as a cis-hetero white male.

# What other funny things have lawyers said to you?

We started looking into this question and realized that we completely forgot to mail out ownership certificates when they were due over a year ago. brb.
