# I still don't get it.
That is understandable.

# So wait, people have actually given you money to do things?
Yes.  We are as shocked as you to learn that there are people in this world willing to write a check to an organization named Bad Idea Factory.

Every accounting department gets incredibly concerned.

# And you actually did those things?
Yes.

# Is it really legal to have a cis-hetero-white-male identity continuation clause?

It is our opinion that it is perfectly legal to automatically close a company if all owners identify as cis hetro white men, but this theory has not yet been tested in court.  In general, with regards to [BIFFUD's bylaws](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/blob/master/documents/operating.md) our lawyer said, and we quote:

> The document you created was insane.  As long as you and the other cofounders understand what you are trying to do, it will work.

Our lawyer stressed that it was important for all terms to be well defined and understood, so we [made a flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BadIdeaFactory/corporate/master/documents/flowcharts/biffud-hetero-cis-white-male-decision-tree.jpg) to help people understand if they identify as a cis hetero white male.

# What other funny things have lawyers said to you?

We started looking into this question and realized that we completely forgot to mail out ownership certificates when they were due over a year ago. BRB.
